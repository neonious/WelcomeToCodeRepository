### (2) Supporting projects


#### CentralNodeWallet (https://github.com/neonious/CentralNodeWallet)

Fully tested Node.JS library which implements a Ethereum wallet which supports multiple addresses, ETH and ERC20 tokens and which takes all required gas from one central Ethereum account.


### (3) low.js (with over 1,000 stargazers on GitHub!)

Before pivoting to becoming a crypto company, Neonious developed low.js: a free to use and open sourced port of the JavaScript runtime Node.js with far lower system requirements, allowing it to run on cheap, power-efficient microcontroller boards based on the ESP32-WROVER module. It also runs on Linux based systems as a smaller, faster booting alternative to Node.JS.

Node.JS is the runtime which is used to build server and standalone applications with JavaScript and is extensivly used in the industry.

You can find the project at: https://github.com/neonious/lowjs
